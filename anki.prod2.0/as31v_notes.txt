Changes in as31v
(1). Database Changes
   Cards table to change the deck_id to VARCHAR(255) to
   integer. Each deck has one or more cards. Each card belong
   to a particular deck. deck_id is the primary key in decks
   table and cards.deck_id is the foriegn key in Cards.
   each card is uniquely identified by cards.id.
   Why do we need cards.card_id and decks.deck_id? 
   There are unique keys created by ActiveRecord system.
   we can use decks.id and cards.id as unique keys to reference
   and associate decks and cards.
   For now, deck_id = id and cards_deck.id is blank.
   updated code to set cards.deck_id = decks.id, so that we can
   list all cards for a given deck or we can edit a specific
   deck or a card.

   Created Migration code in app/db/migration.


(2). File Management
    Now that we mapped decks to cards. We manage all files for a given
    deck in Staging directory under the app. This can be made configurable
    later. We create a directory for every deck  with the deck_id as the
    directory name which makes it easy for us to repackage the cards for a
    given deck after changes are applied to the deck. 

    No files are deleted. we keep image files in the same directory.
    We still need to figure out a way to tell Rails to read all images
    from this directory.

(3). Editing Cards
     Edit form works but still need to fix rough edges

(4). Work In Progress/TODO
     Try to parse the front and back of the decks to replace <img>
     strings with appropriate image locations so taht RAILS would
     render them correctly. Installed new gem Nokogiri commonly used
     for processign HTML fragments. Since we store front and back of
     the decks in database and need to process them to replace 
     any img paths with rails specific one. Once this is fixed, we 
     can fine tune all other stuff.
